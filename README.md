# GeoGrasp - PACKAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION!
Geometry-based method for computing grasping points on 3D point clouds.

We are still working on improving the code efficiency and readability. Moreover, we will add more use cases with real robots. Nevertheless, in its current state, the package already works so a pair of grasping points can be computed for any given 3D point cloud. The repo is a ROS package with the following dependecies:

- ROS Kinetic
- PCL 1.7

The rest of the dependencies (ROS packages) can be found at the `package.xml` file inside the GeoGrasp folder.
