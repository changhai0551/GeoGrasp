# GeoGrasp - PACKAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION!
Geometry-based method for computing grasping points on 3D point clouds.

We are still working on refactoring the code and making it more clear. However, in its current state, the package already works. It has the following dependecies:

- ROS Kinetic
- PCL 1.7

The rest of the dependencies (ROS packages) can be found at the `package.xml` file inside the GeoGrasp folder.
