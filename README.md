# GeoGrasp - PACKAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION!
Geometry-based method for computing grasping points on 3D point clouds. Find more details at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318874422_Using_Geometry_to_Detect_Grasping_Points_on_3D_Unknown_Point_Cloud

We are still working on improving the code efficiency and readability. Moreover, we will add more use cases with real robots. Nevertheless, in its current state, the package already works so a pair of grasping points can be computed for any given 3D point cloud.

# Requirements
The repo is a ROS package with the following dependecies:

- ROS Kinetic
- PCL 1.7

The rest of the dependencies (ROS packages) can be found at the `package.xml` file inside the GeoGrasp folder.

	abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the task of computing a pair of points for grasping unknown objects, given a single point cloud scene with a partial view of them. The main goal is to estimate the best pair of 3D-located points so that a gripper can perform a stable grasp over the objects in the scene with no prior knowledge of their shape. We propose a geometrical approach to find those contact points by placing them near a perpendicular cutting plane to the object's main axis and through its centroid. During the experimentation we have found that this solution is fast enough and gives sufficiently stable grasps for being used on a real service robot.},
